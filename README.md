# Energon
to generate elctricity fron natural resources and store it(without using electricity at all)
hey friends !!!!
I would like to have your opinions and suggestions on my ideaof the project energon.
I'm planning to generate electricity using the factore around us like suppose 
1.the increasing heat(ex body temperature,vehicle exhaust temperature,heat coming out of tar roads)
2.the air that we cut through when we are in motion- for this im planing to use piezoelectric effect
3.Noise around us (that just came to my mind im not sure if its even possible)

I need your views and ideas to get me thruogh this
thankyou
